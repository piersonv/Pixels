Exploring CUDA for PDC

Current project contains Libby Shoop's mandelbrot CUDA code from the Macalester CSinParallel module.
THIS IS NOT OUR CODE
To compile run the command make all
To execute run the command ./mandelbrot
This draws a mandelbrot set to the screen from a png file.
Use ./benchmark and ./XBenchmark to get timing information without graphical display

Current project contains Benedek Vartok's real-time mandelbrot generation with openGL shaders.
THIS IS NOT OUR CODE
To compile simply run make
To execute run the command ./gl-shaders
Zoom/navigate with WASD and E and R.
Create more iterations using arrow keys.

In ProjectCode folder:
This code was written by Virignia Pierson and Ben Lipson.
Currently it's a non-parallelized version of the mandelbrot set.
Coded instead of rendered from a picture.
To compile use gcc -lglut -lGL -lGLU -o mandelbrot mandelbrot.c
To excute use ./mandelbrot
Also has a non-parallelized version of the koch snowflake.
To compile use gcc -lglut -lGL -lm -o koch koch.c
To execute use ./koch
