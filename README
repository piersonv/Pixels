Exploring CUDA for PDC

Current project contains mandelbrot CUDA code from the Macalester CSinParallel module.
To compile run the command make all.
To execute run the command ./mandelbrot.
This draws a mandelbrot set to the screen from a png file.
Use ./benchmark and ./XBenchmark to get timing information without graphical display

In opengl folder:
Currently it's a non-parallelized version of the mandelbrot set.
Coded instead of rendered from a picture.
To compile use gcc -lglut -lGL -lGLU -o mandelbrot mandelbrot.cpp
To excute use ./mandelbrot
