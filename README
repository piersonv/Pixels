Exploring CUDA through openGL for PDC

In ProjectCode folder:

This code was written by Virignia Pierson and Ben Lipson.

Currently has a non-working parallelized version of the mandelbrot set.
Coded instead of rendered from a picture.
To compile use nvcc -lglut -lGL -lGLU -lcudart -lpthread -o mandelbrot mandelbrot.c
To excute use ./mandelbrot

Also has a non-parallelized version of the koch snowflake.
To compile use gcc -lglut -lGL -lm -o koch koch.c
To execute use ./koch

Also has a non-parallelized version of the fractal tree.
To compile use gcc -lglut -lGL -lGLU -lm -o tree tree.c
To execute use ./tree

Also has a parallelized version of a particle rendering system
Written based on Igor Sevo's 'A Million Particles in CUDA and OpenGL' tutorial
It renders over 1 million particles in parallel!
To compile use nvcc -lglut -lGL -lGLU -lGLEW -lcudart -o particles particles.cu
To execute use ./particles

Has a side-view to see the sine wave
To compile use nvcc -lglut -lGL -lGLU -lGLEW -lcudart -o particlesRotated particlesRotated.cu
To execute use ./particlesRotated

Also has a neuroscience simulation using particles to represent neurotransmitters inside brain chambers
This extension was written entirely by Virginia Pierson and Ben Lipson
To compile use nvcc -lglut -lGL -lGLU -lGLEW -lcudart -o neuroSim neuroSim.cu
To execute use ./neuroSim
